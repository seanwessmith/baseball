##1. Select Players from master database and connect to dk.csv || 263 Pitchers should be total
SELECT players.player_id FROM baseball_1461521597, players where players.player_name = baseball_1461521597.name group by players.player_id

##2. Select Players not in master database but in dk.csv
SELECT a.* FROM dk_main a LEFT JOIN players b on a.name = b.player_name WHERE b.player_name IS NULL AND a.position like '%P%'

##3. Select real total points for each Pitchers
UPDATE `pitcher_stats` SET `total_score`= ((`innings_pitched`*2.25)+(`strikeouts`*2)+(`win_result`*4)+(`earned_runs`*-2)+(`hits`*-.6)+(`walks`*-.6))

##4. Select points, salary, total_points from all tables
SELECT sum(total_score), player_name, dk_detail.salary, dk_detail.points FROM players, pitcher_stats, dk_detail, dk_main WHERE players.player_id = pitcher_stats.player_id AND dk_detail.player_id = dk_main.player_id AND dk_main.name = players.player_name GROUP BY player_name
ORDER BY `dk_detail`.`salary`  DESC

##5. Select average points from dk_csv
select name, points, dk_main.player_id,  (sum(points) / count(*)) AS average_points, (MAX(points) - MIN(points)) as points_differance from dk_detail, dk_main WHERE dk_main.player_id = dk_detail.player_id group by dk_detail.player_id
ORDER BY `points_differance`  DESC

##6. Select duplicate pitcher_stats
SELECT player_id, game_date, count(*) FROM `pitcher_stats` group by game_date, player_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC

##7. Remove duplicate from pitcher_stats
DELETE pitcher_stats.* FROM `pitcher_stats` left join (select max(pitcher_id) as pitcher_id from pitcher_stats group by game_date, player_id) a ON a.pitcher_id = pitcher_stats.pitcher_id WHERE a.pitcher_id IS NULL
